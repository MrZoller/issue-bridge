## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) Code of Conduct.

### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening a private GitHub Security Advisory (or contacting the maintainers privately). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**: A private, written warning.
2. **Warning**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior.
3. **Temporary Ban**: Temporary ban from interaction.
4. **Permanent Ban**: Permanent ban from the community.
